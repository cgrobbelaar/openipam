#summary Project coding conventions to be followed when writing code for openIPAM.

We have adopted and follow these practices for all code in openIPAM:

== Variable and function names ==

Follow C-style syntax:

{{{
get_hosts( ... )
__check_permissions( ... )
valid_types = ( types.ListType )
}}}


== Docstrings ==

Classes and functions should have detailed docstrings related to the functionality of the method. Specify `@params` for all arguments, `@return` if the function returns, and `@raise` for conditions under which the function will error.

== Functions ==

{{{
def del_host_attribute(self, aid):
	'''
	Delete an attribute and all data associated with it for all hosts
	@param aid: the database attribute id
	'''
	
	...
}}}

== Classes ==

Classes (just the class names, not an instantiated object) are camel-cased with a capital first letter:

{{{
class MainWebService(XMLRPCController, object):
	...
}}}
