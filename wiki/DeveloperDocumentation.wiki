= Welcome =

openIPAM is a suite of applications designed to provide an intuitive and powerful IP address management system and solution for DNS and DHCP. The development of these applications has been built with the open source philosophy in mind so that other universities and organizations can benefit from (and contribute to) these applications in order to efficiently manage their own network space.

See the [Features openIPAM features] page for more information.

= Customizing openIPAM through the webservice API =

For information about what the webservice API could do for you, see the webservice API section on the [Features features page].

``The core interface foundation of openIPAM is built around a single, fully-functional webservice API. The web application and any other piece that exists outside the backend performs functionality by means of this webservice. All communication between the web layer and the backend or database goes through this webservice layer. For now, our choice of transport has been XMLRPC (no support for SOAP or others at this point).
